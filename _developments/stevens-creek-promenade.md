## Description

Stevens Creek Promenade is a collection of proposals from Miramar Capital Group through their affiliate MPG Stevens Creek Owner LLC for a 9.2-acre site at the intersection of Lopina Way and Stevens Creek Boulevard.

The currently approved project proposes three 6-story residential buildings totaling 580 units—of which 173 are affordable—and a 250-room hotel with 8,500 square feet of commercial space. The project will provide 494 residential and 210 parking spaces for the hotel, totaling 704. Additional amenities include two privately owned publicly accessible paseos, one 14,000 square feet and the other 32,500 square feet.

An amendment to the project splits construction into two phases, with the first phase consisting of only a 173-unit affordable building.

Two additions and revisions are currently under review that may alter the project's scope.

## Timeline

The Los Gatos-based developer Fortbay first proposed a project for the site after it purchased the land for $53 million in 2016.

Fortbay's proposal (PD17-014) encompassed three parcels (29640009, 29638014, 29638013) and proposed four structures:

- Building A: 6-story, 233,000 square foot office building
- Building B: 6-story parking garage
- Building C: 8-story mixed-use building with 10,000 sq. ft. of ground floor commercial and 289 units
- Building D: 8-story residential building totaling 293-units, 88 of which are affordable

Looking north toward Stevens Creek Boulevard, each building occupied a corner of the site, and 2 paseos from the cardinal directions intersected in the middle of the site, forming a cross. Building A occupied the northeast corner, Building B the southeast corner, Building C the northwest corner, and Building D the southwest corner.

The City Council approved this iteration of the project on February 26, 2019. A few months later, the developer applied for a permit to increase the square footage of office space (PDA17-014-01) from 233,000 sq. ft. to 300,000 square feet. However, the developer ultimately withdrew this proposal.

The following year, in 2020, Fortbay sold the project site to Miramar Capital Group and Machine Investment through their affiliate MPG Stevens Creek Owner for $54.5 million.

In 2021, Miramar submitted new plans for the site. Like previously proposed, the new plans proposed four buildings:

- Building A: 6-story, 173-unit, 100% affordable residential building
- Building B: 6-story, 191 unit, market-rate residential building
- Building C: 6-story residential building with 216 market-rate units
- Hotel: 250-room hotel with 8,500 sq. f.t of ground floor retail

The arrangement of the site diverged significantly. Rather than utilizing the entire 9.2-acre site as in the first proposal, Miramar left the 2.6-acre northwest parcel occupied by Davita Medical Group, Satellite Healthcare, and a surface parking untouched.

The three residential buildings now lined the south end of the site, with Building A to the west, B in the middle, and C to the east. The hotel replaced the 6-story office building in the site's northeast corner just above Building C.

Despite shrinking the footprint of the whole building footprint from 296,980 sq. ft. to 241,873 sq. ft., the total unit count remained roughly the same at 580 units with an increased portion of affordable units.

Miramar's revised project was approved on August 11, 2022, roughly a full year after it was initially submitted.

On January 31, 2024, plans to split the project into two phases were approved by the City (PDA20-012-01). The first phase develops Building A, while phase 2 includes Buildings B, C, and the hotel.

In November 2024, the developer filed a preliminary application proposing to replace the hotel and Building C with a 3.79-acre car dealership taking up the entire site east of Lopina Way (PRE24-302). If the developer pursues approval, this modification would reduce the total unit count to 364.

The following month, in December, the developer filed an additional planned development permit for the northwest corner of the site currently occupied by a Round Table Pizza. If approved, this proposal will demolish the existing 10,400 sq. ft. commercial building and construct a new 5,245 sq. ft. Chick-fil-A restaurant. This proposal does not modify the currently approved plans. However, Fortbay's original 2017 plans used this location for a residential building.

As of January 2025, the Chick-fil-A remains under review, and the developer has yet to file a development permit for the proposed car dealership.
