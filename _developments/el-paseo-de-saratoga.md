## Description

El Paseo de Saratoga by Sand Hill Property Company proposes a 4-building mixed-use urban village with 772 units, a 263-bed senior care facility, and a Whole Foods grocery store all on a 10.76 acre site.

Buildings 1 and 2 provide 772 total units and offer 29,00 square feet of retail space. Of the available units, 39  (5% of the total) are designated affordable to households earning 100% of the Aerea Median Income. Building 3 is a single-story entirely commercial space, a large part of which is set aside for a Whole Foods grocery store. Building 4, located on the other side of Saratoga Avenue from the other 3 buildings, is a senior care facility. Site designs also include a new public park and paseo.

El Paseo de Saratoga was originally approved by San José’s City Council on June 21, 2022. The current iteration of the project was approved on December 10, 2024.
